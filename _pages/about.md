## Author

I'm Francois-Xavier Cat and I'm a Systems Engineer focusing mostly on Microsoft and VMware technologies.

I created this blog mainly for the purpose of documenting my day-to-day work. Often I find myself referring back to old posts on troubleshooting issues or previous implementations to help me resolve current problems or tasks.

Hopefully this blog will help some people and contribute to the IT community. :slightly_smiling_face:
