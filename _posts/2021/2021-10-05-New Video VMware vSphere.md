# 1. Presentation of the training

This training video is intended for Network Administrators and Virtual Infrastructure Managers who want to learn how to administer the VMware vSphere 7 suite.

After a reminder on virtual machines, their management and the different deployment modes in a virtual infrastructure, you will study the main features that make up the **VMware vSphere 7 suite**: the **H.A.** (High Availibility) feature that ensures that your virtual infrastructure is always available. (High Availibility) feature that ensures high availability of ESXi hosts as well as **vMotion** and storage vMotion that seamlessly migrate virtual machines between ESXi and the database.

You will learn about `workload balancing` for ESXi servers with **DRS** and its new features and implement **Fault Tolerance** for high availability of virtual machines. Finally, you will explore the **VSAN** (Virtual SAN) feature that allows you to create a shared datastore, consisting of a Flash and a mechanical disk, or just Flash devices, for each ESXi host that participates in the storage creation.

A video application sequence, made with the vSphere Web Client and a PowerCLI script, is associated with each topic studied to facilitate its assimilation while using `best practices in virtualization`
