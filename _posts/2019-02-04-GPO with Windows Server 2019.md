## Summary

This Group Policy book is for administrators and systems engineers and provides immersion in the universe of Group Policies (GPOs) in Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 environments.

The reader navigates between the theoretical principles and the practical applications of the different components that make up the group policies, the only tool that can configure the computers in their system layer in depth. In order to master this tool, the author explains to the reader the functioning and the important relationship that exists between Active Directory, AD replication and GPOs, as well as the process of processing and application of GPOs. These mastered elements will allow you to set up all kinds of Group Policy policies for your business.

In addition, the planning and organization elements necessary to develop an infrastructure based on implementing group policies accompany the reader throughout the various chapters of the book.

The author uses his experience as well as concrete cases to orient the reader's reflection on the technical axes most borrowed by the companies.

Additional items are being downloaded from the www.editions-eni.fr website.
Thanks for reading.
