It's that time of the year! July 1st is the renewal date for all the Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals (MVPs).

I feel honored, proud and pleased to receive the Microsoft MVP award for the first time for the category <b>Cloud and DataCenter Management MVP</b>!

In the last year most my contributions were around:

* [Contributions to Open Source projects](https://github.com/JM2K69)
* [My Meetup for French PowerShell user group](https://youtu.be/MzazXfkysVU)
